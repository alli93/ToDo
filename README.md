# ToDo
A simple To-Do list phone application written using react native and developed on Android devices with Expo for a course 
in app development in Reykjav√≠k university.

The application allows the creation of swipeable components on a scrollable list which are persisted through a Redux state container. 
Each component on the list can then be checked as finished or swiped to be removed from the state container.
